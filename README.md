# Tutor Matching App â€“ UX Case Study

This is a UX case study for a **mobile app** that matches **tutors** (especially university students in need of extra income) with **students** (from elementary to university level) based on compatibility â€” similar to how dating apps work.

The app aims to solve common pain points such as:
- Difficulty in finding the right tutor/student quickly  
- Lack of transparency (e.g., not knowing if the other user is still active)  
- Trust and payment issues  
- Limited networks, especially for international students in Germany  

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- In-app **chat, scheduling, and secure payment system**
- Payment is **held by the app** until both parties confirm the session took place
- Tutors can **upload intro videos** and earn **points** by getting matched  
  â†’ Points can be used for **fee discounts** or **increased visibility**
- Students must indicate whether they are **actively looking for a tutor**
- App shows the studentâ€™s **last active time** to help tutors avoid wasting time

### âœ… Current Progress
- **Lo-fi prototype** completed using **Figma**
- Proceeding with **usability testing** and building a **hi-fi prototype**
- Part of the **Google UX Design Certificate Program**
- Final goal: Build the actual app with a small development team
